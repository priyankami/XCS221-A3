Suppose we have an acyclic MDP for which we want to find the optimal value at
each node.  We could run value iteration, which would require multiple
iterations -- but it would be nice to be more efficient for MDPs with this
acyclic property. Briefly explain an algorithm that will allow us to compute
$V_\text{opt}$ for each node with only a single pass over all the $(s, a, s')$
triples.

The search algorithms explored in the previous assignment work great when you
know exactly the results of your actions.  Unfortunately, the real world is not
so predictable.  One of the key aspects of an effective AI is the ability to
reason in the face of uncertainty.

Markov decision processes (MDPs) can be used to formalize uncertain situations.
In this homework, you will implement algorithms to find the optimal policy in
these situations. You will then formalize a modified version of Blackjack as an
MDP, and apply your algorithm to find the optimal policy.
